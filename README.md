# Create a new Product Category

Forest Protocols consists of a multitude of Product Categories that are incentivized to accelerate digital innovation and prove their worth to the users by building in-demand services. Every digital service can become a Product Category within Forest Protocols. The diversity of Product Categories together with Protocol's inherent interoperability is what adds up to its strength.

The Protocol is permissionless and everyone is allowed to create a new Product Category.

This repository contains instructions and code templates for innovators who want to create their own Product Categories, grow them and earn passive income. What is required of a potential Product Category Owner is to: 
1) [Fork and edit the repository](#1-fork-and-edit-the-repository),
2) [Registering in the Protocol](#2-registering-in-the-protocol),
	1. [Register as a Product Category Owner](#21-register-as-a-product-category-owner),
	2. [Register a New Product Category](#22-register-a-new-product-category), 
3) [Prepare the README file for Users and Providers](#3-prepare-the-readme-file-for-users-and-providers).
4) [Grow Your Product Category by Onboarding Providers, Validators and Users](#4-grow-your-product-category).

## Quickstart

As a Product Category Owner you want to make life easy on Providers that will be adding offers to your PC and servicing clients. That's why you need to create a Provider Template that each Provider will be running to cater to its clients. We have already implemented all of the Protocol level functionality. The only thing you need to do is to define the Product Category specific code.

### 1. Fork and edit the repository

Fork this repository and clone it locally. Open the `src/product-category/base-provider.ts` file. The first step is to define the details each resource will have. At the beginning of the file, there is a type definition named `ExampleProductDetails`, which specifies the attributes stored in the daemon's database for each resource in this Product Category.

Details of a resource are most likely its credentials. They will be accessible for the Users (unless you prefix the detail name with `_`) and can also be used internally by Providers serving in this Product Category. For instance, these details might include connection strings for a Database resource or endpoints and API keys for an API service resource.

Rename the type to match your product and edit the fields accordingly. An example type definition for the SQLite Product Category is shown below:

```typescript
export type SQLiteDatabaseDetails = ResourceDetails & {
  // Fields should use PascalCase with underscores for spaces
  Size_MB: number; // Database file size in MB

  // Fields starting with an underscore are for internal use only and won't be seen by the users.
  _fileName: string; // SQLite database file name
};
```

Once you have defined the details type, update the `BaseExampleProductProvider` abstract class to define this product's supported methods / functionality. This is a set of actions that Users can request your Providers to complete if they have an active Agreement for a service in your PC. All Providers within this Product Category must implement all functions you define in this class. Rename the class to reflect your product. For example:

```typescript
export abstract class BaseSQLiteDatabaseProvider extends AbstractProvider<SQLiteDatabaseDetails> {
  /**
   * Defines the product's functionality. All functions below
   * must be implemented by Providers in this Product Category.
   */

  /**
   * Executes the given SQL query on the database.
   *
   * @param resource Resource information stored in the database.
   * @param query SQL query to execute.
   */
  abstract sqlQuery(resource: Resource, query: string): Promise<any[]>;
}
```

After defining your product's functionalities (e.g., `sqlQuery`), you need to create "Pipe" endpoints to allow Users to invoke these functions.

> "**_Pipe_**" is a simple abstraction layer for HTTP-like request-response communication between participants. The current Pipe implementation is built on [XMTP](https://xmtp.org/) for fully decentralized communication within the Protocol.

Define these endpoints in the `init()` method. For example:

```typescript
async init(providerTag: string) {
    // Call the base class' `init` function
    await super.init(providerTag);

    // TODO: Implement your Pipe endpoints

    /**
     * @param 1:
     *  Pipe endpoints can be defined for different methods such as POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
     *  You can follow the traditional REST pattern to determine which method to use.
     * @param 2:
     *  Path of the endpoint. Clients/users send their requests to this endpoint
     *  to invoke the `sqlQuery` method.
     * @param 3:
     *  Actual handler function that processes the request.
     */
    this.route(PipeMethod.GET, "/query", async (req) => {
        /**
         * In route handler functions, all errors are automatically handled
         * with an "Internal server error" response. If the thrown error
         * is an instance of `PipeError`, the response will use values provided
         * by this error.
         */

        /**
         * Parameters can be extracted from `req.body` or `req.params`.
         * Here, we use `req.body`.
         *
         * We validate the body params using [Zod](https://zod.dev/)
         * to ensure they conform to the expected schema.
         */
        const body = validateBodyOrParams(req.body, z.object({
            id: z.number(), // Resource ID
            pc: addressSchema, // Product Category address
            query: z.string(), // SQL query
        }));

        /**
         * Retrieve the resource from the daemon's database using `getResource`.
         * If the resource is not found, an error is thrown automatically,
         * and the request returns a "Not Found" error.
         *
         * This method also checks resource ownership. If the requester is
         * not the resource owner, the resource will not be found in the database.
         * Even if the return value is not used, calling this method ensures
         * authorization.
         */
        const { resource } = await this.getResource(
          body.id,
          body.pc as Address,
          req.requester
        );

        // Execute the SQL query with the provided arguments
        const result = await this.sqlQuery(resource, body.query);

        // Return the response
        return {
          code: PipeResponseCode.OK,
          body: result,
        };
    });
}
```

Once you are done with defining the abstract class, navigate to `src/product-category/provider.ts` and add a boilerplate implementation for your base class. For example:

```typescript
/**
 * The main class that implements Provider specific actions.
 * @responsible Provider
 */
export class MainProviderImplementation extends BaseExampleProductProvider {
  // Other abstract functions...

  async sqlQuery(resource: Resource, query: string): Promise<any[]> {
    /**
     * TODO: Implement how to execute an SQL query within the database.
     * This function should process the query and return results accordingly.
     */
    throw new Error("Method not implemented.");
  }
}
```

### 2. Registering in the Protocol

#### 2.1 Register as a Product Category Owner

All Actors such as Product Category Owners, Providers and Validators need to register in the Protocol and pay the registration fee before they can start any type of interactions.

TESTNET NOTE: if you need testnet tokens reach out to the Forest Protocols team on Discord.

1. Create a JSON detail file in the following schema and save it somewhere:

```json
{
  "name": "<Name, will be visible to users>",
  "description": "<[Optional] Description>",
  "homepage": "<[Optional] Homepage address>"
}
```

2. Create a set of pub / priv keys using an EVM-compatible wallet.
3. Take that account's private key and save it to a file.
4. Put the JSON file and that private key file into the same folder.
5. Open up a terminal in that folder.
   > If you are planning to use different accounts for billing and operating, you need to pass additional flags: `--billing <address>` and `--operator <address>`. This separation increases security of your configuration. Setting a billing address allows for having a separate address / identity for claiming your earnings and rewards while setting an operator allows you to delegate the operational work of running a daemon and servicing user requests to a third-party or a hotkey. If you don't need that, just skip those flags and the logic of the Protocol will use your main address as your billing and operator address.
6. Run the following command:
   ```sh
    forest register pco \
        --details <JSON file name> \
        --account <private key file>
   ```
7. Save your detail file into `data/details` folder.

#### 2.2 Register a New Product Category

Each Product Category is a separate smartcontract that is deployed by the Registry main protocol contract. To deploy a new Product Category:
1. Create a file with detailed information about this Product Category. The file can be in plain text, Markdown or any other format that you want. 
```json
{
	"TODO": "example file"
}
```
2. Save it at `data/details/[file name]` in your forked Provider Template repository.

```sh
forest product-category create \
  --details <details file path> \
  --account <private key file path OR private key itself of the PCO account> \
  --max-validator 10 \
  --max-provider 10 \
  --min-collateral 10 \
  --validator-register-fee 5 \
  --provider-register-fee 3 \
  --offer-register-fee 2 \
  --term-update-delay 400 \
  --provider-share 45 \
  --validator-share 45 \
  --pco-share 10
```

#### Explanation of Command Flags

| Flag                       | Description                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--max-validator`          | Maximum number of Validators that can be registered.             |
| `--max-provider`           | Maximum number of Providers that can be registered.              |
| `--min-collateral`         | Minimum FOREST token collateral required for a registration.     |
| `--validator-register-fee` | Registration fee (FOREST token) for Validators.                  |
| `--provider-register-fee`  | Registration fee (FOREST token) for Providers.                   |
| `--offer-register-fee`     | Fee for Providers to register a new Offer.                       |
| `--term-update-delay`      | Minimum block count before Providers can close agreements.       |
| `--provider-share`         | Percentage of emissions allocated to Providers.                  |
| `--validator-share`        | Percentage of emissions allocated to Validators.                 |
| `--pco-share`              | Percentage of emissions allocated to the Product Category Owner. |

### 3. Prepare the README file for Users and Providers

Now you need to create a human-readable specification of your Product Category. You have total freedom to shape this document in a way you think is best. However we provide two templates for inspiration (`README_template_1.md`: [here](./README_template_1.md)) and (`README_template_2.md`: [here](./README_template_2.md)). Rename the chosen file to `README.md` (this will override this, but that's fine). 

From now on the `README.md` will include basic information about your PC that might be interesting to Users. It also links to a Provider tutorial on how to easily integrate with your Product Category. So the last thing you need to do is customize the information by filling out the missing parts in your PC's `README.md` as well as in the `README_Become_a_Provider.md`.

### 4. Grow Your Product Category

Congratulations! You have registered in the Protocol and created your Product Category. Now, publish your Provider Template and inform potential Providers and Validators on how to participate in your Product Category.
